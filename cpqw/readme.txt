The original custom tf game code:

This directory contains the original custom TF game code.

The game code is converted with a c file preprocessor so that gmqcc or fteqcc can compile it

The preprocessor is compiled by cppreqcc and it compiles and works in linux now.

To compile the original cp quake server:

make all -j4
