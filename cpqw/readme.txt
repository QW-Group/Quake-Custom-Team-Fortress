# To compile the original cp quake server:

make all -j4


# The original custom tf game code: (qwprogs.dat/prozac.dat)

This directory contains the original custom TF game code.

The game code is converted with a c file preprocessor so that gmqcc or fteqcc can compile it

The preprocessor is compiled by cppreqcc and it compiles and works in linux now.
