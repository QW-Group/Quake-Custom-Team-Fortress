This is the qccx qcc compiler left with the original unmodifed custom tf for the people code

Usage:

./configure

make

./qccx /? --lists options that by the way wont compile

./qccx /O2


Copy the qccx to the cutf_4tp_the_original directory after using ./cppreqcc

There will be an error without debuging with gmqcc. 

To skip debugging use the udpated code included with the this project.
